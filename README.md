> ⚠️ This project has been archived
Due to ongoing harassment, misinformation regarding licensing, and a hostile response from certain communities, this project is no longer maintained.
All licensing issues were resolved prior to archival. I encourage others to review the commit history and draw their own conclusions.
This situation reflects broader challenges within open-source community dynamics that deserve attention.
A more detailed statement will be shared on additional platforms soon.

Thank you to everyone who supported this project.
